## React Tailwind CSS with Tanstack Query and Redux Toolkit starter

Feel free to clone and run the project in your machine.

The Technologies intended for use here are as follows:

- React.js (Create React App)
- Tailwind.css
- Flowbite (Tailwind component library)
- Redux toolkit
- Tanstack query

This is for my personal prefence. Therefore, you might see packages that are not in use in the `package.json`
